## Best Practice


### As Alice, encrypt the secret files and push:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/taojy123/test
Cloning into 'test'...
...
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
$ cd test

$ gecrypt setkey abc123
`abc123` has saved in .git-easy-crypt-key

$ echo MYSECRET=AAA > keys.txt
$ ls
README.md    keys.txt

$ gecrypt encrypt keys.txt 
Encrypt success!
The secret code has been saved in `keys.txt.sec`, and `keys.txt` is ignored by git.
You must keep the secret key `abc123` in mind for decrypt the file in the future!!!
$ ls
README.md    keys.txt     keys.txt.sec

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "add encrypted secret file"
[master 3d8ef6f] add encrypted secret file
 2 files changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 keys.txt.sec

$ git push
...
To https://github.com/taojy123/test
   4d86b27..3d8ef6f  master -> master
$ 
```


### As Bob, pull and decrypt the secret files:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/taojy123/test
Cloning into 'test'...
...
Unpacking objects: 100% (7/7), done.
$ cd test

$ ls
README.md    keys.txt.sec

$ gecrypt setkey abc123
`abc123` has saved in .git-easy-crypt-key

$ gecrypt decryptall
`./keys.txt.sec` has been decrypted to `./keys.txt`.

$ ls
README.md    keys.txt     keys.txt.sec

$ cat keys.txt
MYSECRET=AAA 
$ 
```
